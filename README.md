# AbstractList

This app is entended to accept a csv of data in a specific format and display the list to a user where they will be able to mark the list item as completed.

V1: Import a csv, dispay list to user, allow user to update list item as completed. The goal is to architect this app in an abstract way to facilitate a variety of applications. Specifically, for V1 I want to export a spreadsheet of Blumhouse production movies as a csv that I can import into the app and tick off the specific movie after viewing. 

V2: Create an API that will utilize IMDbs APIs to fetch data that can be massaged and displayed in list form.
